status_blurb: 'The reporting status gives you an overview of how many Sustainable Development Goal global indicators (<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs</a>)
  of the United Nations 2030 Agenda
  can currently be calculated for Germany. The time series for the calculation of the indicators are mainly based on data from official statistics, but also use data collected
  by many other institutions.
  Where data are available, the indicator is marked as <span class="status complete"> Reported online </span>. A suitable data source is still being sought for other indicators. These indicators are marked as
  <span class="status notstarted"> Exploring data sources </span>. Time series are not available for all globally agreed indicators. There can be various reasons for this: the calculation of certain
  internationally relevant indicators for Germany alone makes little sense or the indicators can only be compiled in a global context. Such indicators are marked
  as <span class="status notapplicable"> Not applicable </span>.'
